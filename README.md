## Description

This software is a basic CRM (customer relationship management) system 
which was built for a roof restoration business.

### Problem definition

There are two business problems which this software is supposed to solve:

1. Standardising the sales procedure

Irregularities and lack of system around the sales procedure and
communication between the trades and sales staff had meant that
mistakes were often made and jobs misquoted. A large part of this
was that communication and record-keeping was done on an ad hoc basis.

Having all of the information regarding the customer and their particular
needs in a centralised hub was meant to improve this situation and improve 
communication between the trades and the sales team more generally.

2. Actionable insights to inform marketing spend

The business does not have a clear idea of whether their marketing spends
in certain areas are effective. They define effectiveness as the proportion
of leads which are converted into sales for any particular area. Collecting this
data and displaying it in the application over a period of time would allow them
to make more informed decisions as to where to spend their marketing budget.
For example, if they find that (for example) many leads in Noble Park do not 
convert, then they will stop spending marketing budget in Noble Park.
