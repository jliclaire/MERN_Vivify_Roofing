## Description

This software is a basic CRM (customer relationship management) system
which was built for a roof restoration business.

### Problem definition

The business problem that this is supposed to solve is that of standardising
the sales procedure.

Irregularities and lack of system around the sales procedure and
communication between the trades and sales staff had meant that
mistakes were often made and jobs misquoted. This is a risk 
to both the reputation and bottom line of the business.

A significant aspect of this problem was that communication and record-keeping
was done on an ad hoc basis. Therefore, having all the information regarding
the customer and their particular needs in a centralised hub was meant to
improve this situation and improve communication between the trades and the
sales team more generally.

### Functionality

Our functionality follows from the above two business problems. In the first
place, we want the software to centralise information regarding customer leads
and the development of these over the sales lifecycle, as well as to standardise
interactions and processes concerning the potential customer.

This functionality is covered in the **Dashboard** of the software. An **Admin User** on the dashboard can see all the sales **Leads** and sorted them by their current status in the sales lifecycle, allowing **Admin Users**  to have the complete control. 

Clicking on a **Lead** will display contact information for the potential customer and the details of the job.

Sales leads can be assigned to **Sales Users** whose responsiblity is then
to follow up the the **Lead** in order to quote and potentially sale of the job. At
this stage the Lead is marked as **"in progress."**

The **Sale User** contacts the **Lead** and is required to submit a **Followups** using
the HTML forms which are attached to the **Lead** as a record of securing the job. The **Sales Users** can also provide more unforseen details about the job, photos and sets a quote of which they have sold it. Once this occurs the job is marked as "sold."

### Technology Stack

The software was built using full-stack Javascript: React on the frontend, and
Express and NodeJS on the backend. We use MongoDB for data persistence. The
software is deployed on Netlify (front) and Now (back).

<img src="./docs/Capture-with-followup.JPG">
</p>

#### Add new lead

1. User can create new lead by clicking the "Add New Lead" button from the side bar. A popup window with a new lead form will show and prompt the user to fill related field with customer information. Click Save button to save the new lead or click X button to close the form. After form saved, new lead information will be added and showed on top of the lead list view.

<img src="./docs/Capture-add-new-lead-form.JPG">

#### Add follow up

1. User to click a lead from the lead list to review the details of the lead information
2. User can use "Add Follow Up" form to add comments. A checklist popup window will show after clicking "Add Quote" button. A user has to choose a roof type to see the correspond checklist. after all checklist items are checked, a user will be able to input the quotation amount and proceed to the next field of the follow up form.
3. A user can upload photos by clicking the "choose file" button to choose images from local image storage.
4. Click the "Add Follow Up" button to add the follow up information to show in the follow up section of the individual lead show view.

## Design documentation

### Design process

The designing process primarily focused on simplicity to the UX of the app while meeting the technical requirements. Brett and Luke are seeking a practical way to access and project manage their leads coming through the Vivify website. They said most users will be accessing the app remotely, via mobile phones. 

Our first draft and wireframes was designed for a smartphones client., then we added a desktop design. 

We aim to have the design consistency to Vivify’s website, and since the app is not to be publish publicly, it design is to be purely to enhance its functionality. 

### User stories

The application has two types of users, an Admin who has full access to features and Sales account .

- Admin User can view all the leads from Inbox and archive and direct the unassigned leads two a Sales User. 

- Admin register another Admin or Sales User

- Admin and Sales User can create a new lead or edit an existing lead.

- Sales user can see all the lead assigned to them and can edit leads, add follow ups or upload photos.

### Wireframes

Building on the the previous design process, we made a wireframe to match and colorate for each viewers endpoint.

### ERDs


The application is seperate to the Vivify’s database, and we preferences using MongoDB documenting services, that is easier to alter the Schema during the testing phase with the clients (Vivify)

### OO design documentation

The design of components is relevant flow to the user accessing access the database within the program.  The primary function focuses on Admin Users having full access to create and delete Users, and ability to assign Leads. 


The design of components is relevant flow to the user accessing access the database within the program.  The primary function was to ensure Admin Users has full access to create and delete Users, and ablity to assign Leads. 

 Sales Users are limited to the Leads given to them by Admin and have the ability to update and post follow-ups and images to Leads.

## Short answer questions

1. What are the most important aspects of quality software?

There are at least six core "most" important aspects of quality software. The
first aspect is that it satisfies the logic of the business problem which it
aims to solve. Software is poor quality if it is badly suited to its real world
problem, or if it approaches this problem with an eccentric or overly complicated
logic.

The second aspect is that of reliability. Software should be reliable, in the
sense that it can be used in the same way on different occasions and still yield
the same result, and that it does not break or work in unintended ways.
Reliability can be ensured by thorough testing and error handling.

The third aspect is separation of concerns. A piece of software separates its
concerns when it is well modularised so that each part of the software only
fulfils its own function and is not overly entangled with the other parts.
Software that separates its concerns is more easily extensible than software
which does not.

The fourth aspect is that of scalability. Quality software can work in production
contexts where the load on the system may be much higher than in development
contexts.

The fifth aspect is that of respecting the distinction between configuration and
code. Variables which fit the software to a particular context should not be
hardcoded and should be located in a separate file (e.g, as environmental
variables) so that they can be changed if the software is used in another
context.

The sixth aspect is that of security. All sensitive data that flows through a
piece of quality software should be secured against unauthorised access in order
to protect the privacy of its users.

2. What libraries are being used in the app and why?

We used third-party dependencies on both front-end and back-end.

### Frontend

- React: create-react-app and its dependencies (webpack, babel, etc.) are used
  in order to streamline the process of writing our UI.

- Axios: used in order to make calls to our server and to other APIs, since it
  is more straightforward to use than the native fetch.

- Testing libraries: we use Jest and react-testing-library to test our UI. We
  use Jest because it is intended specifically for DOM testing with React and we
  use react-testing-library because its API is more straightforward and offers
  less opportunity for errors of inexperience than does Enzyme.

- Dotenv: to store secrets in the environmental variables.

- Netlify-CLI: to facilitate deployment.

- React-Router-DOM: to allow endpoints on the client side.

### Backend

- Express: to provide the tools to build our webserver.

- BCrypt: to hash passwords and compare hashes.

- Cloudinary: to facilitate image upload.

- CORS: to set Cross Origin Request settings.

- JSONWebTokens: to create and check tokens for authentication.

- Mongoose: as the model over our database.

- Multer: to buffer image uploads on their way to the cloudinary API.

- Mocha and Chai: for backend testing.

- Nodemon: to enable hot reloading of the server.

3. A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?

There are a number of skills and knowledges that are necessary to develop a
website. These are both technical and organisational. The organisational
skills involve knowing the software development cycle and the team practices
that surround this (e.g., Agile). Some design skills or knowledge would also
be useful for the planning of the website and UX (e.g., wireframing).

The technical skills involve the three languages of the browser: HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. These languages are those which are used to develop on the client
side. If the website also includes server-side code, then the developers might
also want to know a server-side language such as Ruby, PHP, or NodeJS.

If the website also requires the persistence of data, then the team might also
be required to use some sort of database technology, such as MongoDB or
PostgreSQL.

4. Within your own project what knowledge or skills were required to complete the project, and overcome challenges?

As above, we required to draw upon both technical and organisational knowledge
and skills. Firstly, we needed to apply what we had learned about producing a
MERN stack application. This included knowing how to write code and solve
problems in Javascript, but also specific knowledge about APIs, authentication
and authorisation, databases, and Web/Browser APIs.

General progamming skills were very helpful in order to debug or to resolve
issues after the code had been written. These skills allowed us to quickly isolate
and fix bugs in our code.

Organisation-wise, we needed to know how to effectively delegate tasks in order
to take advantage of our strengths and weaknesses and complete the work to a
high standard in the time alotted.

5. Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were this project, using examples, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature.

Our knowledge and skills were adequate to complete a project of this kind, but
we were able to identify ways in which we could improve. 

Firstly, we overlooked some aspects of the device-specific features of the UX 
that made our application
more difficult to use. Specifically, one of the users would be interacting with
our software through an android phone and our user workflow did not cohere
with the typical flow on android. He was quite used to pressing the back button
on his phone and this would break our single page application (it would be navigated
away from the app).

If we had identified this issue earlier we could have made our frontend Routes
more fine-grained in order to better manipulate the browser history. This suggests
two improvements: 1) try to be more thorough in our initial interview with the
client; and 2) manually test on a more specifically targeted range of devices
during development.

Secondly, we could have improved our code review process. We did an informal
code review where we would look over our changes as a team, but we did not
integrate this process into the git workflow. As a result we were not highly
familiar with eachothers code, and were limited in our ability as a team to 
immediately fix bugs. One way to improve on this would be to integrate the
code review process into the process of merging PRs on GitHub, so that at least
one other person, but preferably both, is familiar with the new code.

Finally, frequent refactoring of our codebase might have made our code more 
user friendly during development. Our CSS, for example, was spread across many
files and was prone to duplication. From time to time we had to restructure or
modify the styling and our ad-hoc structuring made doing this more difficult
than it could have been.

We feel that addressing just these issues alone would make us a much more 
effective team in future.
